        <h1 class="sport">‚öΩ soccer! (football?)</h1>
        <p>I play soccer, and have for quite a long time (many many years). I started in the Timbit's house league when around 5. Super easy competition,
            nobody was that good. I moved on to my local travel team, and have remained on it (albeit a few coaching switches here and there). I also play for Nichols
            (varsity next year :|). Primarily, I play left wing, but sometimes I play center back.

    <div class="rowing">
        <h1 class="sport">üö£ rowing / crew</h1>
        <p>Rowing is more of a new sport for me. I started in freshman year as a novice, did meh. Went to a rowing camp over the summer, it was cool (besides waking up at 5 am every day).
            This year, I'm no longer a novice, and spring season is about to start. We don't need to talk about my erg scores.

    <div class="hockey">
        <h1 class="sport">üèí hockey</h1>
        <p>Before I quit hockey after my freshman year, it was easily the most time consuming sport I've played. Started around 7 years old, and I love it. From house to travel,
            hockey was my favorite sport. I loved skating around, feeling the cold air rush by, and the sound of edges digging into the ice (probably weird to most people). 
            Over the years, the different teams I was on were always pretty successful - there's a bunch of trophies and medals in my room from all the tournaments
            we won. Last year, (the last year D:) our team actually won the state championship, and went to nationals (QF loss).
