when building bot-

board evaluation -> could implement lookahead? there is usually a 5 block queue in modern tetris, but if not just have the one in hold
-> does it create holes/peaks/tall pillars/etc to evaluate moves. 


python -m venv venv
python -m pip install pygame


#done
implement soft drop speed 
implement gravity change
implement scoring/combos
implement timer - 2 min
redo lock delay - 0.5s that resets with rotation/move, max 15 rotations on a level

#todo


probably remove the second can_move to consolidate methods
max 15 rotations once hit bottom yk?
#smoother movement? dunno how to really do that 
ghost piece
restart option/lil menu
score board

#todo bot
probably a few other factors?
genetic algorithm of some sort
using hold/queue to get better searches (essentially placing a piece in every position, then bfs again, and again )


could use dictionary to track piece positions that have been visited,
given that the bottom is good
