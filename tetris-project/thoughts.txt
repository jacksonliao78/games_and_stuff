when building bot-

board evaluation -> could implement lookahead? there is usually a 5 block queue in modern tetris, but if not just have the one in hold
-> does it create holes/peaks/tall pillars/etc to evaluate moves. 


python -m venv venv
python -m pip install pygame


#done
implement soft drop speed 
implement gravity change
implement scoring/combos
implement timer - 2 min
redo lock delay - 0.5s that resets with rotation/move, max 15 rotations on a level

#todo
fix rotaiton system (add srs)
add board visualizer for bot to test methods
count holes in board, pits maybe? figure out how to weigh the nodes
probably a few other factors?
implement place piece and remove piece (this one for testing mainly)
probably remove the second can_move to consolidate methods

IMPORTANT FIX VALIDPOSITION _ NEED IT TO TEST IF MOVE IS POSSIBLE NOT IF VALID lol
